Vaccine Prediction

This is my first full fledged ML code attempt.
It uses a simple linear regression algorithm to predict vaccination in Portugal based on a daily basis.

It receives a dataset and tries to predict prices based on a "virtual line".

The dataset was obtained from here: **https://github.com/dssg-pt/covid19pt-data**
The course used as base for this code sample was:
